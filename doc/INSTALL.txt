#Log locations
-If the app doesn't work at all first check the Voxeo\Logs\vappserver.log file for errors.
-Application errors are in the webapps\voxattendant\WEB-INF\log\jsp.log file and can be very helpful when debugging issues.

#General Notes on using Jetty and building the auto-attendant
Jetty is very particular about web.xml configurations, so if you define a servlet class or mapping that is not present, it just won't work.  One clue is that instead of serving up jsp's, you'll get a download file dialog box.  Check your logs when this happens.

If you run a clean build of the project, you MUST create a WEB-INF/log directory if 
it's not already there.  The vox-attendant requires this, but does not create it if 
not already present.  

The app has also been tested with Tomcat, and should run on any standard servlet 
container including JBoss, WebSphere, WebLogic, etc.

#Issues
Please note that if you are testing with contacts that have sip urls versus 10 digit phone numbers for the work phone, then selecting the voicemail enabled checkbox (and provsioning a voxmail account) will not work correctly.  Currently, Voxmail only supports 10 digit TN's and login phone numbers.
